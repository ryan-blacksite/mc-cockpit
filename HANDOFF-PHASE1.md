# Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Owner:** Nicole Preston (Product Manager)  
**Authority:** CEO

## Phase 1 Locked Outputs

| Output | Authoritative File | Status |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Mission Control Vision | `VISION.md` (v4) | **LOCKED** |
| Decision Log | `DECISIONS.md` | Append-only |
| Recent Activity | `RECENT_ACTIVITY.md` | Updated |

All Phase 1 work is consolidated in `VISION.md`. This is the single source of truth.

---

## Phase 1 → Phase 2 Boundary

### What Phase 2 MAY Do

- Translate locked vision into product specs, system architecture, and data models
- Define APIs, schemas, and technical contracts
- Create wireframes and interaction designs that *implement* the vision
- Establish Definition of Done for build phases
- Decompose vision concepts into buildable epics and stories

### What Phase 2 MAY NOT Do

- Modify `VISION.md` without CEO approval and a new version number
- Redefine the zoom model, authority hierarchy, or sector boundaries
- Change the CEO authority principle (AI may never block the CEO)
- Alter escalation classes, spending authority defaults, or governance rules
- Introduce new cockpit sectors or remove existing ones
- Deviate from "serious and professional" tone

### The Rule

> If it's in `VISION.md`, it's settled. Build it, don't debate it.  
> If Phase 2 discovers a vision gap, escalate to CEO for a v2 decision.
