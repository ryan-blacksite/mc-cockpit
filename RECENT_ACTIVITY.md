# Recent Activity

(Keep this short. Bullet points only.)

- Project initialized
- **2026-02-01 (Avery):** Expanded Zoom Model section in VISION.md — formalized zoom levels, visibility/controllability matrix, and "Zoom = Authority" principle. Reasoning documented in BSL-269, BSL-270, BSL-271 comments.
- **2026-02-01 (Avery):** BSL-280 reviewed — conceptually complete per existing VISION.md. Awaiting Fred's buildability confirmation.
- **2026-02-01 (Nicole):** Added "Sector Boundaries & Exclusions" section to VISION.md — explicit inclusions, exclusions, and boundary principles for all six cockpit sectors. Reasoning documented in BSL-272, BSL-273, BSL-274 comments.
- **2026-02-01 (William Parrish):** Added "AI Roles, Authority, and Governance Model" section to VISION.md — authority hierarchy, escalation model (Awareness vs Action), tiered signature authority, spending authority ($0 default), cross-domain disputes, override/veto rules. Reasoning documented in BSL-268, BSL-275, BSL-276 comments.
- **2026-02-01 (William Parrish):** Added Table of Contents and "Future Governance Extensions (Not Yet Implemented)" section to VISION.md — documents Leads tier, escalation-as-routing, tiered signature authority concept, budget delegation, same-level conflict escalation, AI self-auditing. Intent only, no mechanics.
- **2026-02-01 (Nicole):** Locked VISION.md as Vision Doc v1 (Final). Added LOCKED header, logged decision in DECISIONS.md, closed BSL-279.
- **2026-02-01 (Nicole):** Created HANDOFF-PHASE1.md — defines locked outputs, Phase 1 → Phase 2 boundary, and handoff recipients. Closed BSL-283. Phase 1 complete.
- **2026-02-01 (Sergio):** Created `/specs/BOARD-GOVERNANCE-SPEC-v1.md` — deterministic rules for Board onboarding, advisory triggers, Red-Lines, and disagreement handling. BSL-281.
- **2026-02-01 (Fred):** Confirmed BSL-280 buildability — VISION.md provides complete implementation guidance. Closed.
- **2026-02-02 (Fred):** Created `/specs/AI-WORKFORCE-ARCHITECTURE-v1.md` — 5-tier hierarchy (CEO→Chiefs→Managers→Leads→Workers), autonomy model, Pulse cadence, escalation triggers, inter-agent comms. Board explicitly excluded from operational paths. LOCKED. BSL-282.
- **2026-02-02 (Fred):** Created `/specs/MC-RUNTIME-SPEC-v1.md` — execution-grade spec for Claude Code. Infrastructure decisions: Supabase/Postgres persistence, dual real-time channels (Supabase Realtime for data, WebSocket/SSE for AI chat), backend-owned Pulse via Edge Functions + pg_cron. Chat streaming documented as first-class feature. LOCKED. BSL-289.
- **2026-02-02 (Avery):** Created `/specs/MC-COCKPIT-ZOOM-SPEC-v1.md` — execution-grade spec for cockpit layout and zoom mechanics. Spatial dashboard layout, zoom state model, visibility/controllability matrix, 17 invariants, L1 content patterns, API surface. DRAFT. BSL-290.
- **2026-02-02 (Avery):** Finalized MC-COCKPIT-ZOOM-SPEC-v1.md — CEO layout adjustments (Finance large/bottom-center, Governance small/bottom-left), added camera-based zoom with staged detail reveal (Section 5.5), added zoom continuity invariants (Section 8.5). Spec ready for Claude Code. BSL-290 closed.
- **2026-02-03 (William Parrish):** Created `/specs/BOARD-ADVISORY-RUNTIME-SPEC-v1.md` — execution-grade spec for Board advisory system. Covers: Board agent constraints (hardcoded non-blocking), onboarding session runtime (Path A/B phases, state machine), advisory trigger system (9 defaults across 5 categories, Pulse-evaluated), disagreement handling, visibility rules, Governance sector health model, 26 invariants, 20+ API endpoints, LLM integration notes. Board does NOT pulse — system evaluates triggers. DRAFT. BSL-292.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Rewrote `conventions.md` as the constitutional reference for Mission Control. Extracted all invariants from 5 locked/active specs into a single authoritative rulebook: 57 numbered invariants across authority, board, spending, memory, structure, UI, real-time, pulse, escalation, communication, and autonomy. Defined data ownership matrix, naming conventions, API standards, amendment process. Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reference conventions.md as authoritative with conflict resolution instructions.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Finalized conventions.md — reconciled sector names to locked set (Command, Organization, Operations, Finance, Intelligence, Metrics), added Code Style & Readability section (CS-1 through CS-13 including CEO readability test). Total: 69 invariants.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Demoted VISION.md from mandatory Claude Code startup to optional reference in `CLAUDE.md`. Rationale: outdated specifics conflict with conventions.md; dev team carries vision context. Startup sequence now 4 steps.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Rewrote `INDEX.md` as a pure repo map. Removed duplicate Rules section, upgraded conventions.md description to "constitutional source of truth," tagged VISION.md as locked/historical, flagged ROADMAP.md as empty.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Added File Length & Splitting rules (CS-14 through CS-19) to conventions.md Section 7.5. Soft limit 300 lines, hard limit 500. Framework-agnostic language. Total conventions: 75.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Flutter contamination audit — searched conventions.md, VISION.md, and all 5 specs for Flutter/Dart/Widget references. **All clean.** Repo is fully framework-agnostic, no conflicts with React Native + Node.js stack.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Researched Android home screen widget feasibility for React Native. Confirmed doable via `react-native-android-widget` library or custom Kotlin native module. Not a framework blocker.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Created `ROADMAP.md` — Phase 3 implementation plan with 15 tasks across 3 owners (Kori: 6 backend, Bridget: 5 frontend, Fred: 4 integrator). Dependency chains, acceptance criteria, exit conditions. Ready for Linear ticket conversion.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Corrected ROADMAP.md — fixed outdated sector names to canonical set, replaced VISION.md authority references with conventions.md + active specs, added TL;DR summary. 9 patches applied.
- **2026-02-03 (Fred):** Completed "God View" → "Global View" terminology sweep. Patched ROADMAP.md (12 instances), conventions.md (3), MC-COCKPIT-ZOOM-SPEC-v1.md (5). Full repo verified clean — zero remaining instances across all 30+ files.
- **2026-02-03:** Fixed VISION.md v1.2 — corrected "Intelligence & Intelligence" (12 hits), restored ~20 prose locations where generic words were incorrectly replaced with sector names, aligned Operations sector with conventions.md §1.2 (not "the Board sector"), added Finance sector/department disambiguation to both VISION.md and conventions.md.
