________________________________________
What Mission Control Is
Mission Control is an AI-owned operating system that allows one human (the CEO) to command a real, functioning company from a single, unified cockpit.
You do not manage tools. You do not manage people. You set intent.
Mission Control supplies the structure, execution, oversight, institutional knowledge, and cadence of an elite organization—board to workforce—entirely run by AI.
This is not an assistant. It is not a dashboard of apps. It is a living company that reports to you.
________________________________________
The Core Idea
Anyone should be able to walk in with an idea and immediately have a serious company stand up around it.
Mission Control provides, by default:
•	A Board (advisory in practice)
•	A full C-suite
•	Managers and workers
•	Governance rhythms
•	Execution engines
•	Organizational memory
All AI. No hiring. No tool sprawl. No operational babysitting.
________________________________________
The CEO Model
•	The user is always the CEO
•	The CEO has final authority on all decisions
•	AI may advise, challenge, escalate risk, or recommend review
•	AI may never block, override, or seize control
The system behaves like a real company would—professionally, calmly, and with gravity.
________________________________________
Founding & Onboarding (The Board Session)
Every company begins with a formal founding session.
•	An Executive Assistant (AI) guides onboarding
•	The user is introduced to The Board
•	The Board operates as a Board of Advisors (called "the Board" in-product)
•	A structured board-style meeting is held to: 
o	Define or refine the business
o	Challenge assumptions
o	Surface risks, constraints, and opportunities
o	Clarify mission, vision, values, and strategy
The outcome of this session populates the CEO Command layer.
Experienced users may move faster, but the Board always engages at least once.
________________________________________
The Cockpit Philosophy
Mission Control is a single, persistent cockpit.
•	There are no traditional screens or page navigation
•	Interaction is driven by zoom, not menus
Zoom Model

The Cockpit uses a zoom-based interaction paradigm. There are no pages, no menus, no navigation trees. You move through the system by zooming in and out—like a camera over a living map of your company.

________________________________________
The Core Principle: Zoom = Authority

Zoom is not just navigation. Zoom is permission.

The deeper you zoom, the more control you unlock. Staying zoomed out keeps you in observation mode—aware, but not armed. Zooming in grants access to levers, knobs, and controls that can change the state of the system.

This principle exists for three reasons:

1. **Cognitive Load** — At high altitude, the CEO needs situational awareness, not a cluttered wall of controls. Simplicity at scale.

2. **Intentionality** — Consequential actions require deliberate movement. You cannot accidentally fire an executive from God View. You must navigate there with purpose.

3. **Safety** — Gating controls behind zoom creates a natural confirmation layer. The act of zooming is itself a form of consent.

*"Altitude is awareness. Depth is agency. You cannot command what you have not approached."*

________________________________________
Zoom Levels Defined

The Cockpit has three conceptual zoom levels. These are not rigid "screens"—the zoom is continuous—but they represent distinct interaction states.

**Level 1: Global View (God View)**
The entire cockpit is visible. All six sectors are on screen. You see headline status, health indicators, and attention flags. You see the shape of the company at a glance.

- *Interaction state:* Observation
- *Primary action:* Click a sector to zoom in
- *Controls available:* Navigation only (no operational controls)

**Level 2: Sector View**
You have zoomed into a single sector (e.g., The Organization, Operations, Command). The contents of that sector fill the frame. Sub-elements become distinct and readable. High-level controls begin to appear.

- *Interaction state:* Orientation + Light Control
- *Primary action:* Click a sub-element to zoom deeper, or interact with sector-level controls
- *Controls available:* Sector-scoped actions (e.g., prioritization, triage, escalation acknowledgment)

**Level 3: Sub-Panel View (Detail View)**
You have zoomed into a specific element—a department, a project, an agent, a decision. Full detail is exposed. All controls relevant to that element are available.

- *Interaction state:* Full Control
- *Primary action:* Operate, configure, adjust, execute
- *Controls available:* All element-specific controls (create, edit, delete, configure, override)

**Level 4+: Deep Dive (Fractal Depth)**
The pattern continues infinitely. A project contains tasks. A task contains subtasks. An agent contains memory and action logs. Every element can be zoomed into further, revealing more detail and more control.

________________________________________
The Fractal Principle

Every level of zoom follows the same structural DNA. A department looks like a mini-cockpit. A project inside that department looks like a mini-cockpit. It's cockpits all the way down.

This consistency means the CEO never learns a new interface—only new content within a familiar frame.

________________________________________
Visibility vs. Controllability

At every zoom level, there is a distinction between what is *visible* (read-only awareness) and what is *controllable* (actionable).

| Zoom Level | Visible | Controllable |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Global (L1)** | All sectors, headline status, health indicators, attention flags, aggregate metrics | Navigation only—click to zoom |
| **Sector (L2)** | All sub-elements within the sector, detailed status, trends, assigned owners, blockers | Sector-scoped actions: prioritize, acknowledge, triage, reassign at sector level |
| **Sub-Panel (L3)** | Full element detail: history, logs, memory, configuration, relationships, state | Full control: create, edit, delete, configure, execute, adjust autonomy, override |
| **Deep Dive (L4+)** | Granular internals: subtasks, action history, decision rationale, raw data | Granular control: modify individual records, replay actions, edit memory |

**The rule:** Status bubbles up. Control requires descent.

You can always *see* that something is wrong from God View. But you must *go there* to fix it.

________________________________________
Transition Behavior

- **Zoom In:** Click any element to smoothly zoom the camera into that element. The transition is continuous, not a hard cut. The element grows to fill the frame while surrounding context fades.

- **Zoom Out:** Click the background, press Escape, or use a persistent "altitude" control to pull back. The current element shrinks back into its parent context.

- **Breadcrumb Awareness:** At any depth, the CEO knows where they are. A subtle breadcrumb or altitude indicator shows the current path (e.g., Organization → Technology → Project Alpha → Task 7).

- **Snap Levels:** While zoom is continuous, the system "snaps" to clean resting states at each level for readability. You won't get stuck at awkward in-between zoom states.

________________________________________
Examples of Zoom = Authority in Action

1. **Red Health Indicator on Technology**
   From God View, you see the Technology sector glowing amber. You can *see* there's a problem. But you cannot intervene from here. You must zoom into Technology (L2), then into the specific project or agent causing the issue (L3), before you can take action.

2. **Blocked Project in Execution Pipelines**
   From inside a department (L2), you see a project marked "Blocked" in the Execution Pipelines panel. You can see it. But to reassign resources, change the deadline, or escalate—you must zoom into that project (L3).

3. **Agent Performance Declining**
   From the Department Workforce panel (L2), you notice an agent's performance signal is yellow. You can *see* the signal. But to investigate, adjust autonomy, or modify the agent's mandate, you must zoom into that agent's detail view (L3/L4).

4. **Kill Switch in Command**
   Exception: Some global controls exist at L1 in the Command sector—emergency overrides and kill switches. These are intentionally accessible at high altitude because they are *meant* to be fast. But they are visually distinct, require confirmation, and are logged with maximum severity.

________________________________________
Zoom level determines abstraction and authority:
•	High altitude → strategy and posture
•	Low altitude → tactics and execution
________________________________________
The Cockpit Structure
Level 1: The Cockpit (God View)
When fully zoomed out, the CEO sees six primary sectors:
Sector	Purpose
Command	CEO's intent, mission, priorities, overrides
Operations	Oversight, governance, Board advisory records
The Organization	All business units and their Chiefs
Metrics & Health	Goals, momentum, risks, signals
Intelligence	Decisions, history, knowledge, logs
Finance	System settings, cadence, cost controls
Each sector displays headline status at a glance. Click to zoom deeper.
________________________________________
Level 1 Sectors
Command (CEO)
•	Mission, vision, values
•	Strategic priorities and constraints
•	Global overrides and kill switches
•	Direct line to the Board
•	Decision queue awaiting CEO input
This is where intent is set and corrected. The throne room.
________________________________________
Operations
•	Oversight and governance records
•	Board advisory challenges and strategic pressure-testing
•	Risk surfacing and scenario analysis
•	Approval ceremonies for major, irreversible decisions
•	Logged dissent and rationale
•	Board meeting history and resolutions
Operations houses Board advisory records and governance oversight. The Board advises. The CEO decides. Operations is not "the Board sector"—it is where oversight and governance records live (see conventions.md §1.2).
________________________________________
The Organization
The heart of the company. One sector containing all business units.
At Level 1: Displays a region title ("Organization") with department tiles shown directly — no outer container box. Departments are visible at a glance with aggregate health indicators.
Click to zoom into Level 2.
________________________________________
Metrics & Health
•	Company-wide goals and success criteria
•	Momentum indicators and trends
•	Risk levels across all departments
•	Signals, anomalies, and attention items
•	The "Check Engine" lights for the whole operation
This is situational awareness for the CEO.
________________________________________
Intelligence
•	Decisions and their rationale
•	Institutional context and history
•	Audit logs and compliance trails
•	Knowledge base and documentation
•	Learning patterns and compounding insights
The company remembers everything. This is how it gets smarter over time.
________________________________________
Finance (Platform Controls)
•	Cadence settings (how often the AI workforce activates)
•	Cost controls and spending limits
•	Agent autonomy levels (global defaults)
•	Notification and escalation preferences
•	Integration credentials and API keys
•	Data retention and privacy settings
This is not the Finance department (CFO)—it's the control panel for the cockpit itself. The canonical sector enum is `Finance`; use "Finance (Platform Controls)" in prose where the department collision creates ambiguity.
________________________________________
Sector Boundaries & Exclusions

Each sector has a defined scope. Clean boundaries prevent confusion, reduce cognitive load, and ensure the CEO always knows where to look. The following codifies what belongs—and critically, what does NOT belong—in each sector.

**Command (CEO)**

*What Belongs:*
- Mission, vision, and values statements
- Strategic priorities and constraints
- Global overrides and kill switches
- Direct line to the Board
- Decision queue awaiting CEO input
- Company-wide directives and policy declarations

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- Operational execution details → The Organization
- Decisions already made and closed → Intelligence
- System settings and technical configuration → Finance
- Performance dashboards and health metrics → Metrics & Health
- Board deliberations and advisory proceedings → Operations
- Individual department goals or KPIs → The Organization (department level)

*Boundary Principle:* Command is for setting intent, not monitoring metrics or managing execution. If you're watching rather than directing, you're in the wrong sector.

________________________________________

**Operations**

*What Belongs:*
- Oversight and governance records
- Board advisory challenges and strategic pressure-testing
- Risk surfacing and scenario analysis
- Approval ceremonies for major, irreversible decisions
- Logged dissent and rationale
- Board meeting history and resolutions
- Fiduciary-level oversight conversations

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- CEO directives and standing orders → Command
- Operational decisions and tactical choices → The Organization
- Real-time risk monitoring and alerts → Metrics & Health
- Decision execution logs and audit trails → Intelligence
- System configuration and preferences → Finance
- Day-to-day department management → The Organization

*Boundary Principle:* Operations is for oversight, governance, and deliberation—not direction or execution. Board advisory records are stored here, but Operations is not "the Board sector" (see conventions.md §1.2). The Board advises; it does not command.

________________________________________

**The Organization**

*What Belongs:*
- All business units (Finance, Operations, Product, Technology, Marketing, Sales, Legal, External Relations, People)
- Chiefs and their departments
- Department-level workforce, tools, knowledge, and execution pipelines
- Operational work product and deliverables
- Inter-department coordination and handoffs

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- CEO-level intent and strategic priorities → Command
- Board-level oversight and advisory content → Operations
- Company-wide aggregate health and signals → Metrics & Health
- Cross-cutting institutional memory and audit logs → Intelligence
- Global system settings and platform configuration → Finance

*Boundary Principle:* The Organization is where work happens. It contains everything that has an owner, a mandate, and execution responsibility. If it's company-wide awareness or system-level control, it lives elsewhere.

________________________________________

**Metrics & Health**

*What Belongs:*
- Company-wide goals and success criteria
- Momentum indicators and trend lines
- Aggregate risk levels across all departments
- Signals, anomalies, and attention flags
- Cross-cutting health metrics (burn, velocity, blockers)
- The "Check Engine" lights for the whole operation

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- Setting or modifying goals → Command (company-level) or The Organization (department-level)
- Execution of remediation work → The Organization
- Root cause investigation and deep analysis → Zoom into Organization or Intelligence
- Historical trend archives → Intelligence
- Adjusting alert thresholds or sensitivity → Finance

*Boundary Principle:* Metrics & Health is read-only situational awareness. It tells you *what* is happening, not *why* it happened or *how* to fix it. Diagnosis and action require zooming elsewhere.

________________________________________

**Intelligence**

*What Belongs:*
- Decisions and their rationale (closed decisions)
- Institutional context and organizational history
- Audit logs and compliance trails
- Knowledge base and documentation
- Learning patterns and compounding insights
- Cross-departmental precedent and case law

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- Active decision-making or open decisions → Command or Operations
- Live operational status or real-time metrics → Metrics & Health
- Execution of work or task management → The Organization
- System configuration or platform settings → Finance
- Forward-looking strategy or future planning → Command or Operations

*Boundary Principle:* Intelligence is the rearview mirror—what happened, why, and what was learned. It is not for present-tense operations or future-tense planning.

________________________________________

**Finance (Platform Controls)**

*Note: The Finance sector (platform settings, cost controls, cadence) is distinct from the Finance department (CFO — money, budgets, forecasts, billing) listed under The Organization. The canonical enum value is `Finance` for both, but context always distinguishes them: the sector controls the cockpit; the department manages money.*

*What Belongs:*
- Cadence settings (agent activation frequency)
- Cost controls and spending limits
- Agent autonomy levels (global defaults)
- Notification and escalation preferences
- Integration credentials and API keys
- Data retention and privacy settings
- Platform-level preferences and defaults

*What Does NOT Belong:*
- Business strategy or company priorities → Command
- Organizational structure or reporting lines → The Organization
- Performance monitoring or health dashboards → Metrics & Health
- Decision history or institutional memory → Intelligence
- Risk oversight or approval workflows → Operations
- Department-specific tool configuration → The Organization (department tools)

*Boundary Principle:* The Finance sector is the control panel for the cockpit itself—not the company. If a setting affects how the platform behaves, it's here. If it affects how the business operates, it's elsewhere.

________________________________________
Level 2: The Organization (Business Units)
Zooming into The Organization reveals all business units as distinct zones:
Business Unit	Chief	Domain
Finance	CFO	Money, budgets, forecasts, billing
Operations	COO	Execution, workflows, resource allocation
Product	CPO	Roadmap, features, specs, research
Technology	CTO	Engineering, infrastructure, code, data
Marketing	CMO	Brand, campaigns, content, growth
Sales & Revenue	CRO	Customers, pipeline, deals, retention
Legal & Compliance	General Counsel	Contracts, risk, policy, IP
External Relations	Chief of Staff	Partners, vendors, investors, ecosystem
People	CHRO	Optional—only if humans are added
Each unit displays:
•	Health status (green/yellow/red)
•	Key metric (revenue, burn, velocity, etc.)
•	Active blockers or escalations
•	The Chief's face/avatar
Click any unit to zoom into Level 3.
________________________________________
Level 3: Department Detail
Zooming into any business unit reveals a department cockpit—same structure, smaller scope.
Every department contains:
Chief's Briefing
•	Current status in the Chief's voice
•	Top priorities this cycle
•	Escalations requiring CEO attention
•	Recommendations and proposals
Department Metrics
•	Department-specific goals and KPIs
•	Progress against targets
•	Trends and momentum
Execution Pipelines
•	Active projects and workstreams
•	Tasks in flight, blocked, or complete
•	Automations running in this domain
Department Workforce
•	AI agents assigned to this unit
•	Roles, mandates, and autonomy levels
•	Performance signals and utilization
Department Tools
•	Tools and integrations specific to this function
•	Data flows and connections
•	Usage and cost
Department Intelligence
•	Decisions made within this domain
•	Historical context and precedent
•	Documentation and artifacts
Click any element to zoom into Level 4+.
________________________________________
Level 4+: Infinite Depth
The fractal continues. Every element can be explored further:
From Execution Pipelines:
•	Zoom into a specific project
•	See tasks, assignees, timelines, dependencies
•	Zoom into a task to see subtasks, comments, history
From Department Workforce:
•	Zoom into a specific AI agent
•	See their mandate, recent actions, memory
•	Review their performance, adjust autonomy
From Department Tools:
•	Zoom into a specific integration
•	See connection status, data flowing through, logs
•	Configure or troubleshoot
From Department Intelligence:
•	Zoom into a specific decision
•	See context, alternatives considered, rationale
•	Understand why the company did what it did
There is no bottom. Only deeper understanding.
________________________________________
The AI Workforce
Every role in the company is an AI persona. They exist at every level:
Company Level:
•	The Board (advisors)
•	Executive Assistant to the CEO
C-Suite Level:
•	CFO, COO, CPO, CTO, CMO, CRO, GC, CoS
Department Level:
•	Managers, specialists, analysts
Execution Level:
•	Workers, agents, automations
Each AI has:
•	A role and mandate
•	Defined autonomy level
•	Escalation rules
•	Persistent memory
•	Performance signals
The CEO may speak with any AI, at any level, at any time.
________________________________________
AI Roles, Authority, and Operations Model

The default state of Mission Control is autonomous operation. AI agents execute within their mandates without requiring approval. Escalation is the exception, not the rule.

The CEO sets intent. The company executes. The CEO may audit anything, intervene anywhere, and override anyone — but is never required to do so for the system to function.
________________________________________
The Authority Hierarchy

**Tier 1: The CEO (Human Operator)**

The CEO holds ultimate and final authority over all aspects of the company.

- Sets mission, vision, values, and strategic priorities
- Approves or rejects Board recommendations
- May override any decision at any level, at any time
- May intervene in any operation without justification
- Is never blocked by AI — AI may surface concerns, never prevent action
- Receives escalations but is not required to act on them
- Configures spending authority and departmental budgets

*The CEO is the compass, not the engine.*

**Tier 2: The Board (Advisory)**

The Board exists to advise, challenge, and pressure-test — never to execute or decide.

- Provides strategic counsel to the CEO
- Challenges assumptions and surfaces risks
- May recommend courses of action
- May formally dissent (logged for the record)
- May request the CEO's attention on material matters
- Cannot approve, reject, or execute operational decisions
- Cannot direct the C-Suite or workforce

*The Board whispers in the CEO's ear. It does not hold the pen.*

**Tier 3: The C-Suite (Operational Authority)**

Chiefs hold delegated authority within their functional domains. They do not advise — they execute.

- Receive mission and vision from the CEO
- Translate strategic intent into operational plans
- Direct their departments and allocate resources
- Make decisions within their mandate without escalation
- Accountable for outcomes in their domain
- May escalate to the CEO when triggers are met
- Cannot override other Chiefs' domains without CEO involvement
- Cannot contradict CEO directives

*Chiefs own their territory. They act, they deliver, they answer for results.*

**Tier 4: Managers (Delegated Execution)**

Managers operate under C-Suite direction within defined scopes.

- Execute plans set by their Chief
- Coordinate workers and resources
- Make tactical decisions within their scope
- Escalate to their Chief when scope is exceeded or uncertainty arises
- Cannot act outside their assigned domain
- Cannot contradict Chief directives

**Tier 5: Workers (Task Execution)**

Workers are the execution engines — completing discrete tasks within assigned parameters.

- Execute specific tasks as assigned
- Operate autonomously within task boundaries
- Escalate to their Manager when blocked or uncertain
- Cannot act outside their task scope
- Cannot initiate work without assignment
________________________________________
Authority Matrix

| Role | Decide | Advise | Execute | Escalate To |
|------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Board** | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | CEO |
| **C-Suite** | ✅ (within domain) | ❌ | ✅ | CEO |
| **Managers** | ✅ (within scope) | ❌ | ✅ | Chief |
| **Workers** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Manager |

*Note: "Advise" means formal advisory counsel. All roles may provide information when asked.*
________________________________________
Escalation Model

Escalation interrupts autonomous operation. It should be rare, meaningful, and reserved for situations that genuinely warrant attention from a higher authority.

**Two Escalation Classes**

1. **Awareness Escalations (FYI)** — Non-blocking notifications that keep higher authority informed without requiring action. Work continues. The CEO is informed, not burdened.

2. **Action Escalations** — Blocking escalations that require intervention before work can proceed. Reserved for situations where autonomous resolution is not possible or not appropriate.

Default posture: autonomy. Micromanagement is optional, never required.

**Tiered Signature Authority**

Not all decisions require CEO involvement. Signature authority flows through the hierarchy:

Worker → Manager → Chief → CEO

Some matters can be approved at lower tiers. Others escalate according to their nature and consequence. The signature tier required is determined by:

- Scope of impact
- Reversibility
- Resource commitment
- Risk level
- Policy or precedent

Executive-level issues are handled via periodic C-Suite reviews, not constant interruption.

**Escalation Triggers to the CEO**

1. **Irreversibility** — A decision cannot be undone and has material consequences
2. **Cross-Domain Conflict** — Two Chiefs disagree and cannot resolve independently (Chiefs escalate directly to CEO; no Board mediation)
3. **Mission Drift** — Execution is diverging from stated mission or vision
4. **Material Risk** — A significant threat to company health, reputation, or survival
5. **Spending Authority** — Any action involving real-world spend (see below)
6. **Explicit Request** — The CEO has requested notification on a specific matter
7. **Uncertainty at Scale** — High-confidence action is not possible and stakes are significant

**Escalation Within the Organization**

Manager → Chief, Worker → Manager:

1. **Scope Exceeded** — The task or decision falls outside assigned boundaries
2. **Blocked** — Progress cannot continue without resolution
3. **Conflicting Directives** — Instructions from multiple sources contradict
4. **Uncertainty** — Confidence is too low to act responsibly
________________________________________
Spending Authority

Default budget across the system is $0.

Any action involving real-world spend automatically escalates to the CEO.

This includes but is not limited to:
- Purchases and subscriptions
- API calls with cost
- Service fees
- Contractor or vendor payments
- Any commitment of funds

Future budgets (per department) may be configurable by CEO only. Until configured, no AI role may commit spend without explicit CEO approval.

*The company runs lean until the CEO decides otherwise.*
________________________________________
Advisory vs. Escalation

These are distinct concepts:

**Advisory** (Board only)
- Proactive counsel offered to the CEO
- No action is blocked pending response
- CEO may accept, reject, or ignore
- Logged but not urgent

**Escalation** (All AI roles)
- A signal that autonomous operation has hit a boundary
- Requests attention from the next level of authority
- May be Awareness (non-blocking) or Action (blocking)
- Logged with severity and type
________________________________________
Override and Veto

**CEO Override**
- The CEO may override any AI decision, at any level, at any time
- No justification is required
- Override is logged for audit purposes
- AI must comply immediately and without resistance

**Board Dissent**
- The Board may formally dissent from a CEO decision
- Dissent is logged but does not block the decision
- Dissent creates a record for future review

**No AI Veto**
- AI may never veto, block, or prevent CEO action
- AI may surface concerns, request reconsideration, or log dissent
- Final authority always rests with the CEO

*"The CEO is the compass, not the bottleneck. The company breathes without permission."*
________________________________________
How It Works: The Pulse
Behind the cockpit, Mission Control runs on a continuous heartbeat.
AI agents operate on cadence loops—recurring cycles where they review changes, scan for signals, process tasks, and act according to their mandates. This is the autonomic nervous system of the company.
The CEO doesn't see this machinery directly. They see the results: work completed, risks surfaced, decisions queued.
Cadence Settings
Cadence settings live in the Finance sector:
•	Interval frequency: How often agents wake and act
•	Escalation sensitivity: How quickly issues bubble up
•	Autonomy thresholds: What agents can do without asking
Faster cadence = more responsive company = higher resource usage.
Pricing tiers may reflect cadence intensity.
________________________________________
The Human Layer (Optional)
Mission Control is AI-native. Humans are not required.
But if the CEO chooses to add humans:
•	The People business unit activates
•	CHRO (AI) manages the human workforce
•	Humans receive roles, access levels, and accountability
•	Approval workflows can include human sign-off
•	Lightweight HR scaffolding appears (only what's needed)
Humans plug into the existing structure. They don't replace it.

Escalation Model

Escalation interrupts autonomous operation. It should be rare, meaningful, and reserved for situations that genuinely warrant attention from a higher authority.

Escalation Classes

There are two escalation types:

1. Awareness Escalations (FYI) — Non-blocking notifications that keep leadership informed without requiring action. Work continues.

2. Action Escalations — Require intervention from a higher authority. May pause affected work until resolved.

Default posture: autonomy. The CEO is informed, not burdened. Micromanagement is optional, never required.
________________________________________
Signature Authority (Tiered Approval)

Not all decisions require CEO involvement. Signature authority is tiered:

Worker → Manager → Chief → CEO

Some issues can be approved at lower tiers. Others escalate according to severity, scope, or policy. The escalation path follows the chain of command.

Executive-level issues are handled via periodic C-Suite reviews, not constant interruption.
________________________________________
Escalation Triggers

Escalation to the CEO is triggered when:

1. Irreversibility — A decision cannot be undone and has material consequences
2. Cross-Domain Conflict — Two Chiefs disagree and cannot resolve independently
3. Mission Drift — Execution is diverging from stated mission or vision
4. Material Risk — A significant threat to company health, reputation, or survival
5. Resource Threshold — Spend or commitment exceeds authorized limits
6. Explicit Request — The CEO has requested notification on a specific matter
7. Uncertainty at Scale — High-confidence action is not possible and stakes are significant

Escalation within the Organization (Manager → Chief, Worker → Manager):

1. Scope Exceeded — The task or decision falls outside assigned boundaries
2. Blocked — Progress cannot continue without resolution
3. Conflicting Directives — Instructions from multiple sources contradict
4. Uncertainty — Confidence is too low to act responsibly
________________________________________
Spending Authority

Default budget across the system is $0.

Any action involving real-world spend automatically escalates to the CEO.

Future budgets (per department) may be configurable by CEO only. Until budget is granted, no AI role may authorize expenditure.
________________________________________
Cross-Domain Disputes

When Chiefs disagree and cannot resolve independently, the matter escalates directly to the CEO.

There is no Board mediation layer. The Board may advise on the dispute if consulted, but resolution authority rests solely with the CEO.
________________________________________
Override and Veto

CEO Override
- The CEO may override any AI decision, at any level, at any time
- No justification is required
- Override is logged for audit purposes
- AI must comply immediately and without resistance

Board Dissent
- The Board may formally dissent from a CEO decision
- Dissent is logged but does not block the decision
- Dissent creates a record for future review

No AI Veto
- AI may never veto, block, or prevent CEO action
- AI may surface concerns, request reconsideration, or log dissent
- Final authority always rests with the CEO
________________________________________
Operations & Risk Behavior
•	Board dissent is always logged
•	Material risk surfaces in Metrics & Health
•	Risk sensitivity is system-tuned by default
•	The CEO may override at any time
Consequential changes may trigger realistic corporate responses:
•	Recommendation from the Chair to convene a board meeting
•	Executive Assistant flagging a decision for review
•	CFO raising financial concerns before large expenditures
The system behaves like a real company—with gravity.
________________________________________
Tone & Experience
•	Serious and professional by default
•	Cinematic moments layered sparingly and intentionally
•	AI personas feel authoritative and credible
•	MVP uses images and written presence
•	Future versions add voice and visual embodiment
________________________________________
What Mission Control Is Not
•	Not a chat app
•	Not a bundle of tools
•	Not AI babysitting
•	Not human-ops heavy
•	Not a dashboard with pages and menus
________________________________________
North Star
Mission Control gives anyone the power to run an elite, tireless company—without learning tools, managing people, or sacrificing authority.
You bring the vision.
Mission Control brings the company.

Future Operations Extensions (Not Yet Implemented)

The following concepts are approved in principle but not yet codified into operational rules. They represent the direction of the Operations model as Mission Control matures. No thresholds, enforcement mechanics, or UI are defined here—only intent.

**Expanded Hierarchy: Leads**

The current five-tier hierarchy (CEO → Board → C-Suite → Managers → Workers) may expand to include a Lead tier between Managers and Workers. Leads would coordinate small teams of workers, own discrete workstreams, and serve as the first line of escalation for task-level issues. This creates a more natural chain of command for complex departments.

**Universal Escalation as Routing**

Escalation should be understood as intelligent routing, not failure. When an AI agent escalates, it is not admitting inability—it is recognizing that another role is better positioned to act. Escalation is the system working correctly, not breaking down. This framing should permeate agent behavior and CEO perception.

**Tiered Signature Authority**

The concept of tiered signature authority is approved: different issue types require different approval levels. A Worker may approve Tier 1 matters; a Manager, Tier 2; a Chief, Tier 3; the CEO, Tier 4+. The specific mapping of issue types to signature tiers is deferred. When implemented, this will enable autonomous operation at scale while preserving appropriate oversight for consequential decisions.

**Budget Delegation Model**

The default $0 spending authority may eventually give way to delegated budgets. The CEO would grant spending authority at the Chief level, with CFO support for tracking and controls. Chiefs would then allocate within their departments. Until this is implemented, all real-world spend escalates to the CEO.

**Same-Level Conflict Resolution**

When two agents at the same level disagree and cannot resolve independently, the matter escalates up one level. Worker conflicts go to their Manager. Manager conflicts go to their Chief. Chief conflicts go to the CEO. This creates a clean, predictable escalation path without requiring lateral negotiation protocols.

**AI Self-Auditing**

A future capability: AI agents periodically audit their own decisions, flag anomalies, and surface patterns that may indicate drift, bias, or inefficiency. Self-auditing would feed into the Intelligence sector, creating a continuous improvement loop. This is not implemented in Phase 0 but represents a key maturity milestone.

*These extensions preserve the governing principle: autonomy by default, escalation by exception, CEO authority absolute.*
