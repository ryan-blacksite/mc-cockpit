## 2026-02-01 — Phase 0: Cockpit Sectors & Information Architecture

**Epic:** BSL-267  
**Issues Completed:** BSL-272, BSL-273, BSL-274

### What I Did
- Read INDEX.md, VISION.md, and all three child issues under BSL-267
- Confirmed Avery's Zoom Model and "Zoom = Authority" doctrine is already integrated
- Added "Sector Boundaries & Exclusions" section to VISION.md containing:
  - Explicit "What Belongs" lists for all six sectors
  - Explicit "What Does NOT Belong" lists for all six sectors with redirect guidance
  - Boundary Principles for each sector (one-line rules)
- Commented reasoning on BSL-272, BSL-273, BSL-274

### Key Conclusions
- The six sectors are exhaustive and non-overlapping
- Each sector answers a distinct question (intent, challenge, work, status, memory, platform)
- Exclusions are critical—they prevent scope creep and reduce cognitive load
- The "→ redirect" pattern in exclusions ensures the CEO always knows where to go

### Open Questions / Risks
- Boundary principles are conceptual—will need validation during design and build phases
- "Kill switches in Command at L1" is an exception to Zoom = Authority; may need explicit callout in future work
- Outcomes & Health being "read-only" may feel restrictive; UX should make zoom-to-fix intuitive

### Status
Awaiting CEO review. No decisions made—refinement only as instructed.
