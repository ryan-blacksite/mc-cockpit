**Session:** BSL-281 — Define Board Onboarding & Advisory Authority

### What I Worked On
- Created Board Governance Spec v1 (`/specs/BOARD-GOVERNANCE-SPEC-v1.md`)
- Defined deterministic rules for:
  - Onboarding session flow (two paths: CEO has idea vs. no idea)
  - Advisory engagement rules (triggers for normal operation)
  - Red-Line rules (illegal/harmful/unethical = hard stop)
  - Disagreement handling (no formal dissent, side-by-side opinions, CEO decides)

### Key Decisions
- Board is advisory only — never authoritative
- No approval gates, no veto power, no signature workflows
- Red-Lines are the ONLY hard stops (illegal, harmful, unethical)
- Disagreement is surfaced, not resolved — CEO always decides
- Financial/legal/ethical triggers drive advisory engagement in normal operation

### Outputs
- `/specs/BOARD-GOVERNANCE-SPEC-v1.md` — complete, authoritative v1

### Status
**BSL-281 CLOSED** — CEO approved. Spec is authoritative v1.
